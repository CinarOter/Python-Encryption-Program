# Python-Encryption-Program
This is a small Python project I made to practise working with strings, lists, loops, and basic encryption.
The program can encrypt and decrypt messages by matching each character with a randomly shuffled version of itself.

It supports letters, numbers, punctuation, and spaces.

*What the program does :3*

Creates a list of characters (letters, numbers, punctuation, etc.)

Makes a copy of that list and shuffles it to create a “key”

Encryption: replaces each character with the one in the same index in the shuffled key

Decryption: does the same thing but in reverse

Basically, every character gets swapped with another one, and only the shuffled key can undo it.

*Example:*
*------------------------*
*Original:  Hello!*
*Encrypted: %A$92~*
*Decrypted: Hello!*
*------------------------*

(The encrypted part changes every time because the key is random.)

Why I made this:

I wanted to understand how simple ciphers work and practise:

1) indexing

2) loops

3) lists

using the random and string modules

It was also a fun way to see how encryption works at a basic level.
That's All..
